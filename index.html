                    <p>My name is River Hoffman, I am currently a college student and a driven Front-End Developer; born and raised in the great city of New York. From a young age, I have been inspired to create; I dabbled in plenty of art forms: music, photography, and videography etc. I became intrigued with website design and development once I entered college. There I mastered the front-end programming languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery, but also became equipped to use the programs on the Adobe Creative Suite, so I could comprehend the production of content.</p>
                    <p>As of May of 2019, I will be graduating from Rochester Institute of Technology, with a Bachelors of Science in Applied Arts &amp; Science with a Minor in Chinese. I am currently looking for a full-time position where I can flourish and be a part of a creative team, making an impact on the world.</p>
                    <p>This website is a portfolio of my previous work, which I tend to update on a monthly basis and a way for interested people (like yourself) to get in contact with me.</p>

                                <h2>CMDS 510 | Multilingual Website</h2> For my capstone project, I decided to focus on RIT’s online publications; I realized they were only produced in English. What about the other popular languages that are prominent on the Internet? I created a mock website through Drupal 8 for one of the school’s news publications with the function to translate entire articles from English to Simplified Chinese, which would then be available to the reader.
